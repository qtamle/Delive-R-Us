A few easy steps are required in order to ensure proper function of the pack.

	1. Please make sure you install the proper version in your Unity Project. At the moment, only Built-in and URP are supported.

	2. Depending on the Unity version, the Color Space might be set to "Gamma" by default. Make sure you set it to "Linear", in order for the lighting to function properly.
You can find the Color Space setting in: "Edit > Project Settings > Player > Other Settings > Rendering"
