Before using the project, you need to install standard assemblies!
Such as: Vehicles and Characters. They are needed if you need cars
and people for control.
Download them from the top menu bar: Assets / Import Package

After installing the Standard Vehicles
you need to replace the script of the Car Controller.
From the folder: UTS_PRO/ ReplaceMe 
to the folder: / Standart Assets / Vehicles / Car / Scripts
